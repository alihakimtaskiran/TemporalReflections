Simulation of Temporal Reflections Phenomenon on Light

Temporal reflection refers change in direction of light through the time, not the space as usual mirrors. The phenomenon described detailly in this paper(Vol. 31, No. 6 / 13 Mar 2023 / Optics Express 9165). Please not that I am not authot of the paper and this repository includes resources to demosntrate the phenomenon. In the code, temporal reflections cancel out a light source.
